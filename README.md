## 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. 
The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. 
The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 4:
```
Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880
```

Example 5:
```
Input: head = [0,0]
Output: 0
```
Constraints:
- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
- Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

## August 21st, 2020 Week 3 Challenge Problem: Sort Array By Parity

Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting 
of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```

Note:
1. 1 <= A.length <= 5000
2. 0 <= A[i] <= 5000

## August 20th, 2020 Week 3 Challenge Problem: Reorder (Linked) List

Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Example 1:
```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
```

Example 2:
```
Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```
