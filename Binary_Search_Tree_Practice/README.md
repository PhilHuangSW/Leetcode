# [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/) Binary Search Tree Practice Problems written in Ruby.

## Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
Output: [1,2,3]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
Output: [1,3,2]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
Output: [3,2,1]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Binary Tree Levelorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```
